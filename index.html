            <p id="bio">Migrating from the arts into tech, packing up my creative side to take with me. SAG/AFTRA and Equity professional performer with IMDb credits as Consulting Editor on a feature film. </p>

           <p id="p2"> I have produced and written web commercials, self-produced, narrated, edited and mastered audiobooks for Audible and Scholastic; I have written everything from plays to product descriptions with SEO terms for Walmart. I am a bilingual/bicultural US citizen and have translated medical case studies as well as subtitles for Turkish soap operas into English. </p>

           <p id="p3"> I also work as a business roleplayer, with two London-based organizations that coach executives in their leadership roles--clients include Microsoft, Aetna, Barclay's, Ortho Diagnostics and New York Medical College. Looking forward to streamlining my various skills into one comprehensive web development position in a multi-media, globally engaged company.</p>
